### micro-webpage

#### Work in Progress
Setting up flask microservice wepbage for family-owned brewery/brewpub, allowing for admin access to easily change menu, beer on tap, schedule, relevant info, etc.

Possibly integrate with shopify BuyButton.js, depending on flexibility gained.

TODO: setup mongoDB locally instead of SQLAlchemy.
